    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It's often referred to as a single threaded synchronous , scripting language because it's typically used to write scripts that are embedded in or included from HTML pages and interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web browser. JavaScript is a dynamic, prototype-based language with first-class functions, meaning functions are treated as first-class citizens, allowing them to be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.</p>
    <h3>Why JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is widely used for web development because it enables interactive and dynamic content on websites. It's supported by all modern web browsers.It's also used for server-side development (Node.js), mobile app development (React Native), desktop app development (Electron), game development (Unity), and more. <br>JavaScript (JS) is a versatile language that can be used for both front-end (FE) and back-end (BE) development.</p>
    <h3>Where JavaScript is used?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is primarily used in web browsers to enhance the functionality of websites and web applications.It's also used on the server-side with Node.js to build scalable network applications.JavaScript can be found in various environments beyond the web, including mobile app development, desktop app development, game development, IoT (Internet of Things), and more.</p>
