    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Javascript is a programming language that makes web applications more dynamic and interactive.It is used to create or build the functionality to the website.Javascript had multiple definitions like </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Javascript is a lightweight,cross-platform,single-threaded and interpreted compiled programming language.</li>
        <li>Javascript is a scripting language and used to provide functionality to webpages.</li>
        <li>Javascript is compiled programming language.</li>
        <li>Javascript is a single-threaded language.</li>
        <li>Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language.</li>
        <li>Javascript is a high-level language.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Synchronous single-threaded:</h3><span> JavaScript is primarily synchronous,JavaScript operates on a single thread within the browser's runtime environment. This means that it can only perform one task line by line in the order it appears in the script at a time from start to finish. </span>
     <h3>High-level:</h3><span>JavaScript is designed to be easy to read and write, abstracting away low-level details and providing developers with a more intuitive syntax.
    </span>
    <h3> Interpreted:</h3><span>JavaScript code is executed line by line by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution. This allows for rapid development and easy debugging but may result in slightly slower performance compared to compiled languages.
    </span>
    <h3>Scripting Language:</h3><span> JavaScript is often used for scripting tasks, especially within web development. It's commonly embedded within HTML pages and executed by web browsers to provide dynamic and interactive functionality.</span>
    <h3>Javascript code executed in one of two runtime environment:</h3>
    <h3>1.A browsers runtime environment. <br>
   2.The node runtime environment.</h3>
    <h3>Browsers are Chrome,Edge,Firefox,Opera.</h3>
    <p>Chrome browser runtime environment is V8 javascript engine.This can handle execution of Js code.V8 engine can modify.Js engine written in c++.</p>
    <h3>V8 Javascript Engine:</h3>
    <p>The V8 engine is what powers chrome and chromlum.Its also used in node js.Its a Js engine written in c++.It is a open source and mainly maintained by google.There are other Js engines,like Spidermonkey which powers Firefox and Jscore that powers Safari. <br> The V8 engine is responsible for parsing,compiling and executing Js code.And it needs to manage memory,control the flow of execution,optimize the code and interact with environment.</p>
    <h3> Document Object Model (DOM)/ Browser Object Model (BOM):</h3><span>JavaScript interacts with the DOM, which represents the structure of HTML documents as a tree of objects. This allows JavaScript to manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically, enabling interactivity and responsiveness. Browser Object Model (BOM) in JavaScript provides access to browser-related features like controlling windows, manipulating the document (web page), navigating browser history, and retrieving information about the user's screen and browser environment. It enables JavaScript to interact with the browser itself, beyond just the content of web pages.
    </span>
    <h3>Heap:</h3><span>The heap is a pool of memory where variables,objects and references stored.</span>
    <h3>Stack:</h3><span>The stack is a data structure that keeps track of what program is doing at any given time.</span>
    <h3>Call Stack:</h3><span>Call Stack is a place where all my JS code executed.</span>
